// You can also use a powerful third-party library called Axios to make GET calls to a local JSON file instead of fetch API. By loading data directly 
// from a local JSON file you can save your server from tons of unnecessary calls in local development. Alternately, by saving the JSON file as a 
// regular JavaScript file and exporting the entire object globally, you can use it inside any component and save a considerable amount of development time when working with external APIs.
